# Defikarte.ch - the Swiss Defikarte

![alt text](screenshot.PNG)

## Idea and implementation

The idea for this page came to me when I was driving through a sleepy village in the canton of Graubünden and at regular intervals a sign showed me the next location of a defibrillator. I realized, that by far not all cantons do this and that the defibrillator locations are mostly unknown.

Then I went to look for the data in my hometown and got this information. I then entered the data in OpenStreetMap and defibrillators were now maintained in my community. But I quickly began to think outside the box and wanted to know how the data stock looks like across Switzerland. When querying the data, I was very surprised by the result and I thought that this data should be used. I found two or three other maps that were more or less manually maintained. I found this method too cumbersome and wanted my card to benefit directly from community data contribution, so I launched Defikarte.ch.

The card is intended to help everyone find a defibrillator quickly and efficiently in a hectic, unusual situation.

Important: Defi's displayed in green are accessible 24 hours a day. Defis displayed in orange can be reached with restrictions or during opening hours.

## Tools

The following tools are used to get the data from Openstreetmap:

### Overpass

Overpass API and its GUI Overpass Turbo make it easy to call up data from OpenStreetMap directly. No layer or intermediate storage is necessary for this.

Well-known endpoints for the API are:

* [Overpass Turbo EU] (<https://overpass-turbo.eu/>)
* [Overpass SOSM] (<https://overpass-turbo.osm.ch/>)
* [further links to API endpoints] (<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API#Public_Overpass_API_instances>)

#### Interrogate

**show all defis in Switzerland**

```
/ *
This has been generated by the overpass-turbo wizard.
The original search was:
"Emergency = defibrillator in CH"
* /
[out: json] [timeout: 25];
nwr ["emergency" = "defibrillator"] ["opening_hours"! = "24/7"]; out center;
```

**show all defices in Switzerland that are available 24 hours a day**

```
/ *
This has been generated by the overpass-turbo wizard.
The original search was:
“Emergency = defibrillator and opening_hours =" 24/7 "in CH”
* /
[out: json] [timeout: 25];
// fetch area “CH” to search in
{{geocodeArea: CH}} ->. searchArea;
// gather results
(
  // query part for: “emergency = defibrillator and opening_hours =" 24/7 "”
  node ["emergency" = "defibrillator"] ["opening_hours" = "24/7"] (area.searchArea);
  way ["emergency" = "defibrillator"] ["opening_hours" = "24/7"] (area.searchArea);
  relation ["emergency" = "defibrillator"] ["opening_hours" = "24/7"] (area.searchArea);
);
// print results
out body;
>;
out skel qt;
```

### Umap

The card itself is embedded via an iframe and is actually an Umap card. The Swiss branch is managed by the SOSM.

Umap can be found here in [Github] (<https://github.com/umap-project/umap>)

### App-Stores

The App is available in the Appstores.
